## Bunny Jump
Followed through 10 chapters of game development using the Phaser 3 HTML5 game framework in modern JavaScript.
The game weâ€™ll be making is an infinite jumper like Doodle Jump.
The objective is to get as high up as you can by jumping on platforms that disappear as they leave the bottom of the screen.
Falling is a death sentence. Well, virtual death sentence. You can always respawn.
